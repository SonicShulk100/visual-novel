### Main Phase 1

Sonic : "(Hmm... This card seems useless, but it should be able to negate Loki's effect... Wait... I think I have a plan.) I Activate Bardiche's effect! By sending one *Phantom Knights* monster from my deck I get to set a *Phantom Knights* spell or trap card from deck as well. I send [Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=12201&request_locale=en) from deck to the graveyard to set [Phantom Knights' Fog Blade](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=12205) from deck!"

## Turn 6

### Draw Phase

Shulk : "I draw!"

*Shulk then drew a card.*

Sonic : "I chain with *[Effect Veiler](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=8933)*'s effect from hand! By discarding this card your Vanadis' effect is downright negated until end of turn!"

*Sonic then discarded Effect Veiler from his hand to negate Vanadis' effect.*

Shulk : "(Unfortunately, even though my Loki is now vulnerable for card effects, it will not be an issue.) I activate my spell card *[Monster Reborn](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=4842)*! This spell card lets me bring back a monster from the graveyard. I choose to bring back Ljosalf from the graveyard!"

*With the effect of Monster Reborn, Shulk Brought back Ljosalf from his grave.*

*Shulk sent Ljosalf and Gullveig from the field to the graveyard.*

Shulk : "I Link summon *[Security Dragon](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13489)!"

*Shulk then Link summoned Security Dragon, with its ATK of 1100 and LINK of 2.*

Shulk : "And because Security Dragon is co-linked with Vanadis, I use the former's effect to return your Break Sword! And because it's an XYZ monster, it goes back to your Extra Deck instead of your hand!"

Sonic : "N-No way!"

*With the effect of Security Dragon, Shulk returned Break Sword back to Sonic's Extra Deck.*

Shulk : "I'm not even DONE with you! Link arrows confirmed! It needs two to three effect monsters to summon it! I send Security Dragon and Vanadis!"

*Shulk then sent Security Dragon and Vanadis from his field to the graveyard.*

Shulk : "Appear! Link 3, *[Decode Talker](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13036)*!"

### Battle Phase

Shulk : "Battle! Loki will destroy your Bardiche!"

Sonic : "I reveal another Magnetring to-"

Shulk : "Have you forgotten about Loki's effect?"

*Before Sonic could reveal Magnetring, Loki instantly destroyed it. Then Loki destroyed Bardiche, making Sonic lose 1200 LP.*

Sonic : "Fog Blade's effect from the grave! I banish it from the graveyard to bring back Bardiche!"

*Sonic then sent Ancient Cloak from deck to the graveyard.*

Sonic : "Sword's effect from the grave! I banish it from the graveyard, to bring back Ancient Cloak in defense mode!"

*Sonic banished Sword from the graveyard to bring back Ancient Cloak in defense mode.*

*Shulk then normal summoned Garmr of the Nordic Beasts in attack mode, with its ATK of 800 and DEF of 1900. Because he summoned it on one of the zones Talker pointed to, Talker gains another bonus of 500 ATK, making it a total of 3300.*

### Battle Phase

Shulk : "Battle! Garmr will attack your Ancient Cloak!"

Sonic : "But your Garmr's ATK is 200 lower than Ancient Cloak's! It can't destroy it by battle that easily!"

*Indeed, Garmr failed to bite off Ancient Cloak and was pushed back, making Shulk lose 200 LP.*

Shulk : "Who said I needed to destroy it by battle...?"

Sonic : "Wait what?"

Shulk : "What I was going for is that after I took the battle damage, because Garmr battled a monster that is a level 3, which is lower than 4, I can return that monster from your hand! *Howl of Despair*!"

*Garmr Howled, making Ancient Cloak disappear right back to Sonic's hand.*

Sonic : "N-No way!"

Shulk : "Yes way! Now, Loki and Talker! Obliterate!"

*Both Loki and Talker obliterated Sonic's LP down to 0.*

[Sonic's LP : 0]
[Shulk's LP : 2900]

*The Winner is Shulk!*
